# RocketElevators-AI-Chatbot

## About The Project

For the 13th week of the Odyssey program, this dialogflow bot was created in order to be able to interact with the database from Slack.

This bot allows users to:
  - get a report about the general state of all the products
  - get the status (elevator, column, battery)
  - modify the status (elevator, column, battery)
  - create an intervention
